# Social-Network-API 👥

Social media is everywhere, and used by so many. It's no surprise that developers are starting their own social media applications. With tha build comes the need to handle large amounts of unstructured data. That's where this API using a NoSQL database comes in.

## Installation 🖥️

To install this on your local environment, git clone the repo. Then run 'npm i' to install the dev dependencies associated with the app. Then copy and paste routes from the thoughtRoutes.js and userRoutes.js into a testing app like Insomnia or Postman. Before running GET routes, it is helpful to run POST routes to create new users and respective thoughts so that GET routes will retrieve some type of data.
